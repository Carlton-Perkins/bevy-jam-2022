# Unfair Advantage

## Brain storming

- BulletHell/Shmup where the game is just hard or gets harder over time
  - Lots of enemies and lot of projectiles, should scale well with bevy!
  - PC is overpower, or scales really really fast
- Top-Down Dungeon crawler where enemies are dangerous
  - Hard from the start where anything could kill you
- Platformer where levels are hard
  - Like Doodlejump where it gets harder the higher you climb

### Theme

Trains! Player movement is constrained to the tops of moving trains. Trains may be moving at various speeds and in different directions which can change the play area as you play.

Enemies are cowboys that can enter the scene on horseback and can hop onto trains and join the player on top of the trains. Sometime enemies will spawn on trains that are entering the screen.

A boss could be a train coming on-to-screen that has projectiles and embedded turrets on its roof.

Store is another train that enter the field periodically.
